# ERMIA
It was proposed at SIGMOD'2016 by Kangnyeon Kim.
SSN is serialization certifier which has to be executed serial.
Latch-free SSN was proposed at VLDB'2017 by Tianzheng Wang.

## How to use
- Build 
```
$ make
```
- Confirm usage 
```
$ ./ermia.exe
```
- Execution example 
```
$ numactl --interleave=all ./ermia.exe 1000 10 224 100 off 0 on 2100 10 100 10000 3
```

## How to select build options in Makefile
- `ADD_ANALYSIS` : If this is 1, it is deeper analysis than setting 0.
- `BACK_OFF` : If this is 1, it use Cicada's backoff.
- `KEY_SORT` : If this is 1, its transaction accesses records in ascending key order.
- `MASSTREE_USE` : If this is 1, it use masstree as data structure. If not, it use simple array Î±s data structure.
- `VAL_SIZE` : Value of key-value size. In other words, payload size.

## Optimizations
- Backoff.
- Early aborts.
- Latch-free SSN.
- Leveraging existing infrastructure.
- Rapid garbage collection.
- Reduce cache line contention about transaction mapping table.
- Reuse version.
